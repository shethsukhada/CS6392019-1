I am Sukhada Sheth and I tested the app of Prakash Thakuri.
The Min and Target versions of the SDKs are 15 and 28.
I tested the app on a emulator with Android Pie 9.0  sssx86 
The app does not crash.
The app does display:
Hello Prakash Shashi Thakuri
And
Welcome in CS 639 Summer 2019
Everything looked as required. No specific comments to improve.
